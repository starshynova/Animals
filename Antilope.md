Antilope is a genus of twisted-horn bovid that contains a single living species, the blackbuck of South Asia. Two extinct species are also known.
Many fossil antelopes were included in this genus, but have since been placed in new genera; for example the species formerly known as Antilope planicornis is now placed in its own genus, Nisidorcas.
